## **🧠 Reasons for development**
After solving the sudoku on papter, **it was annoying to check if it was correct**.
<br>
<p>-> Plan to create a program that checks the correct answer to Sudoku.</p>
<p>-> Added this and that functionality. </p>
<p>-> That result is this.</p>
<br>
<br>

## **🛠 Feedback**
- There is some inconvenience while playing.
    - It will be added. (maybe... 😅)
- The part of the Board.check_result function showing the results is a bit lacking.
    - simplely use alert function.

## **😁 Update logs**
- 23.07.02 : Completion of the plan.
